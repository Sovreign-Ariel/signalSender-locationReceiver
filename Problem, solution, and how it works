Problem:
After any natural disaster we can send drones with mini cell towers to places which phone towers have been compromised. 
The drones can then pick up signals from cell phones which send back the GPS location where a potential victim might be.
Also, during certain disasters, such as wildfires, potential future victims can receive the—already triggered—WEA, allowing them 
a opportunity to leave the threatened area.

Solution:
After any natural disaster we can send drones with mini cell towers to places which phone towers have been compromised. 
The drones can then pick up signals from cell phones which send back the GPS location where a potential victim might be.
Also, during certain disasters, such as wildfires, potential future victims can receive the—already triggered—WEA, allowing 
them a opportunity to leave the threatened area.

How it works:
While utilizing the current WEA system for disasters we can ensure that, with the use of a drone which has a mini cell phone 
tower, people without the reception to receive the alert will then receive the necessary signal to hear the WEA.
Packets will then be sent back to the antenna with a GPS location of that phone, allowing for emergency responders to see the 
location of the vicinity where the phone and potentially trapped people might be.
